# Geometry Dash Difficulty Information

This site is for informing GD players about the real difficulty a level has.

The point of this site is showing a graph that tells users what the hardest part of a level is, or the so-called "difficulty spikes."

Users can vote a certain number for each 10 percentage. Other users can check a graph to grasp what the hardest part of a level is, so they can focus their practice on the most important parts.

We will clearly have a moderation system and locked levels, because we all know there are some people who would make 91556 have a difficulty of 10/10.

User system? I don't know. But a rate-limiting system, yes.

Integration with Geometry Dash? I don't know, I don't like C++ as much to make a mod.
